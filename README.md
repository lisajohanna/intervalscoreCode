# Comparing Confidence Intervals for a Binomial Proportion with the Interval Score
This GitHub repository accompanies the arXiv preprint [arXiv:2207.03199](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03199).

Figures can be reproduced in three steps (in this order):

1. Load the functions in functions.R
2. Load the settings in settings.R
3. Run the .R files for the figures (figures 5 and 6 could take around 6 minutes to compile)
